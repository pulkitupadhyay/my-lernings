    <h1>Here are the details of NGOs</h1>
    
    <font>
        The non governmental organisations play a very crucial role in the promotion of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. They work in direct contact with the local people. Keeping the city clean is everyone‚Äôs duty and to ensure that people are made aware of this civic duty the NGOs play a very crucial role. 
    In ensuring the success of this cleanliness mission the NGOs play their part in the following ways:-
    </font>
    <ul>
        <li>üìçNGOs take up the task of educating the local mass making them aware of the need to keep their surrounding clean.</li>
        <li>  üìçNGOs also play a crucial role in providing toilets to the rural areas and the slum where there is a lack of proper sanitation facilities.</li>
        <li>üìçNgos could also adopt certain villages or areas in requirement of proper sanitation facilities and carry on the cleanliness drive in those areas. </li>
        <li>üìçNGOs could also work closely with the municipality to execute a daily cleaning plan in a certain area.</li>
        <li>üìçMany NGOs even visit schools to teach the children the importance of cleanliness.</li>
        <li>üìçNGOs can also facilitate workshops on how to recycle and reuse non biodegradable wastes into livelihood programs.</li>
        <li>üìçMany a times NGOs are authorized to collect money from houses and use it to arrange for segregation and separation of waste.</li>
        <li>üìçCertain NGOs from time to time conduct research on specific areas to specifically dispose waters, improved toilets, improved composting processes and many more.</li>     
        <li>üìçMany a times certain NGOs are given access to the Swachh Bharat city local circles to share community initiatives with the citizens and mobilize them to lend their helping hand whenever required.</li>
        <li>üìçNGOs often take up the task to set up waste management systems and monitor the same.</li>
   
    </ul>

<h3>2.. Shashi foundation:-</h3>

<font>Cleanliness is a natural and human choice, universally. Given a choice and the power to decide, people always prefer CLEAN and good environment. No illiterate or poor person will ever prefer a dirty piece of cloth over a clean piece while purchasing it by paying the same amount.
    
    But when offered a lower price for the dirty cloth, he/she can purchase it for saving his /her hard earned money. The choice for the dirty cloth, in the second situation, is reflecting the development deficit and not a cultural deficit.
    
    The deficits need to be removed by the elites and the urbanites first because they structure the development goals. Often, we talk about 'corporate social responsibility'. We also talk about government's responsibility. We seldom talk about 'individual's social responsibility' or 'intellectual's social responsibility'. Let's consider it our individual responsibility to make our home, our city and our country clean.

<h3>4.. SATO</h3>
 <font>One in three people in the world still lacks access to safe sanitation. These people in countless communities, who rely on open pit latrines or empty fields to relieve themselves, are exposed to infectious diseases, insects, and terrible odors every day.
    Lack of toilets in many areas leads a staggering 892 million people worldwide to relieve themselves outside (also known as ‚Äúopen defecation‚Äù). This contaminates water sources and exposes women and children to the risk of violence and harassment.
    Every day, an estimated 800 children under 5 years of age die from diarrheal diseases because of these preventable causes.
    SATO aims to solve these problems by providing affordable and easy-to-install toilet systems to local communities around the world. These products are safe for children and eliminate many of the causes of preventable diseases.
    The ground-breaking product line has won a number of prestigious awards, including the Red Dot Design Award and the Deputy-Chief‚Äôs Award from the Japan SDG Awards.
    LIXIL developed the first product in the SATO series‚Äîthe blue plastic toilet pan placed directly over a single pit‚Äîwith funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The toilet pan was launched in Bangladesh in 2013.
    SATO toilet pans feature an automatically-closing trap door that blocks odors and insects. A small amount of water (0.2 to 1 liter) opens the trap door to eliminate waste, which shuts itself tightly after use.
    In 2017, a model called the SATO V-trap Connection System was developed for the Indian market. Each SATO product is designed to meet the unique needs of the local market it serves.
    Today, more than 4.3 million SATO units have been shipped in countries around the world, effectively improving sanitation for over 21 million people*.SATO products have been shipped to over 38 countries, including Bangladesh, India, Kenya, and Uganda</font><br>
